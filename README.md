🚀 Small Projects Collection

A collection of simple but impactful projects I built to explore different areas of programming, from APIs and 3D rendering to real-time tracking and game mechanics. Each project showcases key concepts like UI design, interactivity, and basic physics.

🔧 Projects

🟢 Weather App with 3D Globe
Tech: Three.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Built a weather app featuring a spinning 3D Earth globe. Users can enter a city name and view simulated weather details like temperature, humidity, and wind, powered by a custom mock API.

🚗 2D Car Model
Tech: HTML Canvas, JavaScript

Created a 2D car in a dark environment that users can control with keyboard keys. Demonstrates basic physics, movement mechanics, and responsive input handling.

📍 GPS Tracker
Tech: JavaScript, HTML/CSS

Designed a location tracking interface with real-time updates and map visuals to simulate object movement across U.S. locations using mock data.

📊 Automatic Status Monitor
Tech: JavaScript

Built an automated system that monitors device/system statuses and sends real-time simulated alerts to improve operational awareness and reliability.

💡 Why These Projects?

Each of these projects helped me:

Practice DOM manipulation and API integration
Explore animation, real-time data handling, and interactivity
Strengthen front-end development fundamentals
