🚀 Interactive Web Projects

A collection of simple but impactful projects I built to explore different areas of programming, from APIs and 3D rendering to real-time tracking and game mechanics. Each project showcases key concepts like UI design, interactivity, and basic physics.

🔧 Projects


📊 Automatic Status Monitor

Tech: JavaScript

Built an automated system that monitors device/system statuses and sends real-time simulated alerts to improve operational awareness and reliability.
